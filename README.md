## Introduction

### Model link - https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML

This repository contains a text generation model based on Llama2 GGML. Llama2 has several improvements over Llama1, such as being trained on 40% more data, handling longer text (4k tokens), and using advanced attention techniques. GGML helps make the model smaller and more efficient without losing performance. The model also uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to reduce errors and give better answers by using a custom knowledge base. These updates make the model more reliable and accurate and avoid challenges like hallucinations.
